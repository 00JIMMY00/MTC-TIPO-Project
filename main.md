# **AI-Driven Elbow Splint System — Project Outline Prompt**

**Write a complete architecture and workflow for a rehabilitation elbow-assist device that uses:**

* EMG
* IMU
* Encoder
* Stepper motor
* Microcontroller
* Cloud-based AI refinement

**The workflow must include only the following high-level stages:**

1. **Sensor Data Collection**
   * Collect processed features from EMG, IMU, encoder, and motor driver.
2. **Daily Data Packaging & Upload**
   * Compress and send daily session data from the controller to the cloud.
